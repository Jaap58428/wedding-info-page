                    <p>If you're already wondering what to wear, we got some tips for you.</p>
                    <p>The celebration will be at a mini-camping with a wild hippie spirit (see <a href="">LOCATION</a> page for more detailed infos).</p>
                    <p>We think that anything that reminds you of festivals or flower power would be a great look.</p>
                    <p>But most of all, we really want you to feel yourself! So, come in your favourite outfit or in something where you are truly who you are! We're here for it!</p>
                    <p>Please don't feel like you need to buy anything new! Check your wardrobe first or go for second hand/vintage. Sustainability for the win :)</p>
                    <p>If you have more questions about this: ask Julia haha</p>

                    <p>We would love to get a donation for our adventure honeymoon instead of material gifts.</p>
                    <p>If you still want to get us something: please think sustainable, vegan and support local businesses.</p>
